# The MVP of the I Affirm Me app:
I Affirm Me simply returns meaningful, true affirmations to the client from an external Affirmations API with the click of a button. Upon login, users gain access to additional original affirmations by category. 

## Details for the I Affirm Me app
A final project for Techtonica 2022H2 cohort. The required template (written by Cristina from Techtonica - https://github.com/Yosolita1978) provided the foundation for an app that ran CRUD operations. You can see a copy of the starting point of my app with Auth0 integration included here: https://github.com/mx-ruthie/final-project-template. According to other requirements, I also connected my own database containing at least 2 tables, utilized an external API (https://github.com/annthurium/affirmations), and implented Auth0 for login.
